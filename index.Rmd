# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Welcome to my course on how to write your thesis and publish the contents in the biological sciences. This guide is pitched at postgraduate students, but is applicable to anyone who is writing scientific papers and wants to know more. It is not going to tell you what to write, but to open and examine the black box of scientific writing and publishing, and more broadly explore how this impacts the academic context. My intention is to demystify writing and publishing in the biological sciences, so that you will become aware of what to expect when you prepare to publish your thesis chapters.

 Online activities and workshops:
 
 - All online activities will be posted here in this guide. If you have difficulties accessing this site or any of the content, please let me know immediately.
 - Within each online activity there are **Exercises** listed which are obligatory activities for every student. These must be individual to the student (no groups and no duplicate results).

## Before you start {.unnumbered}

Many of the exercises in this course will rely on you having an active research project that you are starting or working on. The idea is that you will use skills learned in this course directly on your own project. If you do not have a project, or your project is at such an early stage that you are unfamiliar with the literature, you should ask your advisor **now** for five papers that will be important for your project (preferably not all by them). 

If you don't get five of your own papers, then you will be using five papers on topics that I choose: i.e. you will be working for me! It will be much better for you if you do the work in this course for yourself.


## Text books {.unnumbered}


Depending on just how early you are in your career, there is a lot missing from this book that has been provided in two other books [**How to write a PhD in Biological Sciences**](www.howtowriteaphd.org) and [**How to publish in the Biological Sciences**](www.howtopublishscience.org). Those books should be consulted whenever you feel that you want more information - you should also consult articles, papers and other literature that is cited in this guide and those books. Whenever possible, I have put links to chapters in these other books. They have the look and feel of this guide, so watch out and don't get lost!

The course will be pulled from the two course texts:

## Acknowledgments {.unnumbered}

There are a great many people that I need to thank. First and foremost are the members of my lab, past and present, who have inspired me to put together first the blog posts and then the book. It is because you wanted more that I put this together. This book contains lots of links to blogs and articles written and posted freely on the internet by others who also aim to demystify and help. I thank this greater academic community (especially \#academicTwitter) for sharing and inspiring. Thanks go to the many reviewers and editors who have taken their time to improve my writing. I am still learning. Lots of the text in this book has been improved by feedback from my students and postdocs. A special mention must go to my brother, Richard, who has hosted my lab website for more than a decade, and especially for saving blog posts from hacking attacks. Thanks also to my wife, Thalassa, who proofread many of the blog posts after I had published them late at night, so that I could correct them over breakfast in the morning. James Baxter-Gilbert, Dan Bolnick, Jack Dougherty, Anthony Herrel, Allan Ellis, Rachael Lammey (CrossRef), Andrea Melotto, Lisa and Mark O'Connell, Ivan Oransky (Retraction Watch), Heather Piwowar (ImpactStory), Claire Riss (Center for Open Science), Johan Rooryck (cOAltition S), James Vonesh, Carla Wagener all read or commented on different aspects of the book. Thanks are also due to my colleagues at the Centre for Invasion Biology, the Department of Botany and Zoology, and Stellenbosch University. A special thanks to the librarians who have supported many of my more extreme rantings about publishers.
