# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Welcome to my thesis writing guide on how to write your thesis and publish the contents in the biological sciences. This guide is pitched at postgraduate students, but is applicable to anyone who is writing scientific papers and wants to know more. It is not going to tell you what to write, but to open and examine the black box of scientific writing and publishing, and more broadly explore how this impacts the academic context. My intention is to demystify writing and publishing in the biological sciences, so that you will become aware of what to expect when you prepare to publish your thesis chapters.

## Why read this book {.unnumbered}

Publishing a paper in an academic journal should simply consist of submitting a publication worthy manuscript. But having a working knowledge of publishing will enable you to make better decisions about what, where and how to submit manuscripts. This all comes with experience, and in this book, I try to explore the areas of assumed knowledge, and furnish them with explanations pitched at the Early Career Researcher, along with links and citations where you can read more. I explain the many choices that exist for those wishing to submit a manuscript for publication in the Biological Sciences. Where possible, information in this book are tailored for the biological sciences, and when this information was not available for the Life Sciences, STEM or science (in that order). I explore the world of publication bias, and how this is evidenced by reviewers and editors. Impact Factors, citations and how the desire to track the performance of academics has led to unethical practices and exploitation of science and scientists. This guide provides an "everything you wanted to know about publishing but were afraid to ask" approach for anyone who still feels that submitting a manuscript is like posting it into a black box. This book is written to get you onto an even footing.

## What's not in this book {.unnumbered}

Depending on just how early you are in your career, there is a lot missing from this book that has been provided in two other books [**How to write a PhD in Biological Sciences**](www.howtowriteaphd.org) and [**How to publish in the Biological Sciences**](www.howtopublishscience.org). Those books should be consulted whenever you feel that you want more information - you should also consult articles, papers and other literature that is cited in this guide and those books.

## Structure of the book {.unnumbered}

This book is written in nine parts:

[**Week I - The philosophy of science**](#Week1) why we need to record what we do; standing on the shoulders of giants; living your life scientific

[**Week II - The hypo-deductive model in science**](#Week2) big questions in your field; reviewing the literature; how to write a hypothesis; citing the literature

[**Week III - Transparency**](#Week3) the movement for Open Science; Preregistration; data curation

[**Week IV - A model for thesis writing**](#Week4)  – introduction; methods; results; discussion

[**Week V - Nuts and bolts of writing**](#Week5)  – sentences; paragraphs; logical arguments; examples; citation databases

[**Week VI - Publishing your thesis chapters**](#Week6) choosing a journal; preparing your submission; Open Access and reviewing models

[**Week VII - Peer Review**](#Week7)  writing a rebuttal; how to conduct peer review

[**Week VIII - When science goes wrong**](#Week8)  publication bias; the evolution of bad science; rewards and retractions

[**Week IX - Your future in science**](#Week9) 9.	 – mental health; networks; careers



## Acknowledgments {.unnumbered}

There are a great many people that I need to thank. First and foremost are the members of my lab, past and present, who have inspired me to put together first the blog posts and then the book. It is because you wanted more that I put this together. This book contains lots of links to blogs and articles written and posted freely on the internet by others who also aim to demystify and help. I thank this greater academic community (especially \#academicTwitter) for sharing and inspiring. Thanks go to the many reviewers and editors who have taken their time to improve my writing. I am still learning. Lots of the text in this book has been improved by feedback from my students and postdocs. A special mention must go to my brother, Richard, who has hosted my lab website for more than a decade, and especially for saving blog posts from hacking attacks. Thanks also to my wife, Thalassa, who proofread many of the blog posts after I had published them late at night, so that I could correct them over breakfast in the morning. James Baxter-Gilbert, Dan Bolnick, Jack Dougherty, Anthony Herrel, Allan Ellis, Rachael Lammey (CrossRef), Andrea Melotto, Lisa and Mark O'Connell, Ivan Oransky (Retraction Watch), Heather Piwowar (ImpactStory), Claire Riss (Center for Open Science), Johan Rooryck (cOAltition S), James Vonesh, Carla Wagener all read or commented on different aspects of the book. Thanks are also due to my colleagues at the Centre for Invasion Biology, the Department of Botany and Zoology, and Stellenbosch University. A special thanks to the librarians who have supported many of my more extreme rantings about publishers.

# What is a scientific journal for? {#whatjournalfor}
<br>
It’s worth reflecting on why we have scientific journals, and what they are for. Primarily, journals are a means of communication for the academic community. The academic community here should be regarded in the broadest of interpretations. For example, some journals also serve to disseminate research to other those who draw-up and implement policy. Others are aimed at managers who want to base their actions on scientific findings. The direction and inclusivity of the audience is pivotal in both [what](#whattowrite) and how we write.

- Journals record and disseminate the findings of individuals and teams of academics from all over the world. 
- By having a date when they are published, together with the names of the authors, they record primacy; that is who came up with the finding or idea first. Also see important arguments against the need for primacy [@casadevall2012reforming].
- They attempt to register legitimacy by collating and integrating comments and concerns through [peer review](#peerreview).
- Lastly, they archive these findings so that in future people can build on the work. 


There are so many scientists in the world publishing so many papers that it's not possible for all scientists to read everything. Today annual growth in scientific papers is 5.1%, equivalent to a doubling time of 13.8 years [@bornmann2020growth]. Contrast this with the early days (back in [1665](https://howtowriteaphd.org/citations.html)) when there were only two journals and they represented the only published material at the time. Over time there has developed a natural hierarchical system of what scientists will read. This is reflected in citations, and the simplest measure of journals is something called the [Impact Factor](#impactfactor). 

It has been said that ‘authorship’ is a relatively modern concept, emerging from the empiricism of England’s middle-ages [see @cronin2001hyperauthorship]. In our recent history, it is considered to be important for individuals to record who thought of what and when. From these authors, we give societal ‘author-ity.’ This gives credit where it's due. In the big scheme of things of course it's not important who did it. We know from historical examples like Darwin's theory of natural selection and Wallace’s very similar thoughts will merely be a product of many people who were thinking about these ideas at the time. Although certain authors may be ‘ahead of their time’, the majority of thoughts and ideas that come around today are a product of their time. However, for individuals and their institutions it can be important to claim credit as this may translate into some monetary value (e.g. with patents) or a prestige value. The regulated system of taxonomy puts a lot of importance on the priority of who described what and when (see [here](https://howtowriteaphd.org/citations.html#what-about-citations-as-taxonomic-authorities)).

The system of editors and peer reviewers determining whether or not a manuscript possesses sufficient merit to be published is still regarded as the gold standard in science [@mayden2012peer]. As you will discover, it is often a very high bar to achieve. Of course both editors and peer reviewers are human and so the system is not perfect. We'll talk more about peer review in [another chapter](#peerreview). 

Archiving the findings of scientists is perhaps one of the most important roles of publishers that we should be most concerned about. In my career, I have seen the changes from strictly paper dissemination of scientific findings, as it was for the past 350 years, to primarily electronic findings many of which are never printed by the majority of readers. We should be concerned about how long these records will last. If you have never thought about the longevity of data storage, then this is something that you should give some thought to. We all need to change our perspectives on long-term thinking as this impacts almost every societal function (see the [Long Now Foundation](https://longnow.org/)).

## What will journals be?

There is much that has not changed between the first publications (from [1665](https://howtowriteaphd.org/citations.html)) and journals we see now. But there are signs that they are changing. Throughout this book you should note the importance of **transparency and reproducibility** and how this implies that researchers now need to publish their data and the code that provided their results. This helps form the continuum of [Open Access, Open Data and Open Communication](#openscience) that we saw in Figure \@ref(fig:open-science). The future will demand that we integrate not only the narrative description of the authors, but also the data, code and the way in which all aspects were selected for publication (through [peer review](#peerreview) or another means). There are also calls for the finished work to be linked to the proposed work through [preregistration](https://howtowriteaphd.org/transparency.html#preregistration) of projects.

It is clear that we have not arrived at a model of what scientific journals will look like. However, we do know already that we need to aspire to a model that maintains the **rigour and independence** required to maintain the [scientific project](https://howtowriteaphd.org/lifescientific.html).

# The obligation to publish your work {.unnumbered #publish}


Now that you've submitted your PhD, you still need need to do something with it. For most of you this will be publishing it in a journal of your choice. Publication is important. Here is a list of reasons why you have some obligation to publish the work in your thesis:

- If your work is unpublished, then it will not be used. Without use, all the work that you put into it falls away.
- Your published work will become the foundation for future students and academics who are active in your field. This might well be in another country or on another continent.
- Your work was most likely paid for by tax-payers in the country where you studied. Publishing this work is a way of handing back the value of what you found. If it is published Open Access, the public can also read it for themselves. 
- Other funders of your thesis work may have made publication a prerequisite of the funding criteria.
- It is hoped that by publishing your work it will become more accessible to the scientific community.
- By publishing your work you will find that both you, and your work, become known by an international community that may well invite you to participate in the academic process further [@marks2013misusea].
- Both inside and outside of science as a career, peer-reviewed published papers are seen as an important accomplishment in addition to the production of your thesis.
- The work that you have already put into your thesis (especially if you have followed the advice in this book!), will mean that you are close to having chapters that can be submitted as publications. 
- Your advisor and lab colleagues who helped with your thesis work may depend on your publications. 
- There is a lot of satisfaction to be had by seeing your work published. It has been argued that this depends on who you are and where you come from [@husemann2017publicationism]. 
- The satisfaction of having someone say how enjoyable or inspiring your work is to read will certainly not be as frequent as if you managed to publish a novel or newspaper column. But when it does happen, it will bring a smile to your face.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, but I hope it will give you some insight into the importance of publishing your results. To counter this assertion, please be aware that there is also research that suggests that publication driven science is not healthy, and that we need a new paradigm to motivate science [e.g. @stergiou2014impact]. Indeed, it has been suggested that the ‘publish or perish’ mentality of academia has resulted in the retention (and even deterioration) of poor experimental design, and hence higher false positives in the behavioural sciences [@smaldino2016natural]. However, before you can join the debate about the future, I’d argue that you need to provide your credentials for the present.

Taking your work to the next level is not a trivial step, even though you already have your chapters written in the style of manuscripts. The challenges of publishing work, like other challenges in academia, are much easier if you possess inside knowledge of the system. The demystification of the next steps along the road in academia is the subject of another book.

# What happens if you don’t have a hypothesis? {#nohypothesis}

So far, we have concentrated on thesis chapters or manuscripts that have [hypotheses](#hypothesis) to test. I have emphasised that there is a need to focus all of the sections of your writing to helping frame and understand the hypothesis (in the [Introduction](#introduction)), explain your approach in collecting and testing the variables (in the [Materials and Methods](#methods)), provide the results of your tests (in the [Results](#results)), and respond to the hypothesis (in the [Discussion](#discussion)) together with placing it in context. But what, I hear you cry, if you don’t have a hypothesis to test?

There are lots of reasons why manuscripts don’t have hypotheses, and the chances are that in a PhD thesis (for example) you will have at least one chapter where there isn’t a hypothesis tested. So, given all the emphasis above, what can be done?

## Central problematic
If you have a particular problem that your research is trying to solve, this may result in a new methodology or perspective rather than testing a hypothesis. This work is still suitable for a journal manuscript (and there are specific journals dedicated to new methodologies). Instead of introducing your hypothesis, you can simply introduce the problem that your methodology applies to. A new methodology will probably best fill an existing gap, and so your introduction will likely point out what this gap is, provide evidence for why existing methodologies don’t fill the gap, and outline the variables in your novel approach. 

Similarly, if you have a question but not a hypothesis, that your research tries to answer, you can take exactly the same approach to introduce your question. 

Hence, no matter what your central problem is, you still need to identify this and put it at the heart of your manuscript so that all of your sections address this point. Of course, there may be more than one, and if so, you will need to clearly articulate each one and explain how they are related to each other. If you are unsure about how to move forward, the best thing to do is to look to the literature for other examples of what you’re trying to do. Someone has very likely done something similar before. Don’t forget to chat about it with your advisor, as they may have ideas about where to look.

## Does it matter that you don’t have a hypothesis?
Having a hypothesis makes your work stronger than if you only have a question or prediction. In each case, while your results might help answer your question or confirm your prediction, they won’t test the mechanism (so that you can’t explain why you have the results that you do), and they may not be falsifiable/refutable. Of course, Popper would argue that if you don’t have a null hypothesis, then your methodology isn’t scientific. 

To me, it is important for you to know exactly what your study is before you start writing about it, or even before you do the experiments. It is essential for you to frame the context of your study. The central reason why you are writing the study will lie at the heart of the manuscript. In the formulaic approach, it will be verbalised at the end of the introduction. All parts of the methodology will explain how you approached this central aim. So if you can’t pin down what this is, then make sure you discuss it with your advisor.

## Avoid HARKing 
Hypothesising After Results are Known (HARKing) is the practice of creating your hypothesis once the results are in and you’ve done some preliminary data analyses to see what is significant [@forstmeier2017detecting]. HARKing has become prevalent in science because of the confirmation bias by journals (only accepting papers that can statistically accept the alternative hypothesis), especially those with higher impact factor. Increasing chances of confirmation bias, or a [Type I error](#TypeI), is not desirable as you are more likely to accept the alternative hypothesis when it is not correct. Alternatively, you should seriously consider [preregistering your aims](#transparency) to remain transparent.

# The Acknowledgements {#acknowledgements}

This is the part of your manuscript where you get to thank all of the people who have helped you along the way. It is easy to forget people and so it is worth considering making notes about who has helped you along the entire time with your PhD. Then all you have to do is remember where you wrote it down!

## Thank your funders

You should thank any people or organisations that funded you or any component of your work. Check with them they may have specific wording that they want you to use. Remember that your institution may not have given you money but may have supported you in other ways, and you should probably thank them. There are registers of funders, and you should use these to see whether your funder is present and exactly how they should be acknowledged. One example is the [Crossref Funder Registry](https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/). Funders rely on being able to search [databases](#databases) for their name and find all of the work that they have funded. This means that you should use the particular wording that they supplied, especially if they specify this in their funding letter.

If your funders aren't in the database, you might suggest that they get added. 

## People and organisations to thank

 - Try to remember all of those people who helped you doing fieldwork, or in the laboratory. Especially laboratory technicians (if they are not also authors) without whom a lot of the work that we do isn’t possible.
 - People that may have helped administer your funds or other office administration. 
 - Organisations that gave you permission to do your work. In some journals, the acknowledgements are the correct place to put your permit numbers along with the names of the organisations who provided them. 
 - Increasingly, permission from ethics committees is placed in the materials and methods but do check with the journal instructions to authors.
 - People who supplied you with samples, images or other elements of your work or presentation of your manuscript.

Many journals have specific ways in which they want people's names to be written. You will need to follow the guidelines. For example, authors are often referred to by their initials in the acknowledgements. This is useful when some people in your paper need to thank particular funding bodies who didn't fund others.
Thank anyone who gave you a photograph that you used in the paper.

## Who not to thank (in your manuscript acknowledgements)
 - You do not need to thank anyone who is an author. The exception is in your thesis acknowledgements, where you should mention them and their support.
 - Personally, I tend not to thank people who were paid to do a specific job and only did that job. The acknowledgements is a section to name people who have gone out of their way to help you.
  - Your family for getting you to grad school (unless they really helped you do the work). However, in your thesis acknowledgements, you should absolutely include your family.

If in doubt, it's probably a good idea to be as inclusive as you can in the acknowledgements.

If in doubt with the acknowledgements refer to other acknowledgement sections in the same journal and see how they are formatted and written. Remember that if your journal is conducting double-blind review, they may ask for the acknowledgements (and the title page) to be removed from the main manuscript and uploaded separately.

# Tables {#tables}

If you think that tables are just about displaying a series of boring numbers, then it’s time to free your mind. Tables are an amazing vehicle to display information that can be numeric, written or pictorial. From the simplest of two by two tables with several levels of organisation, the reason for putting your information in a table is that you can provide it in a simpler and easier way to the reader than if you were to put all the information in full into a paragraph of text. There are few rules on Tables, but you'll find some guidelines in this Table \@ref(tab:tables). 

Most journals want tables formatted so that there are only horizontal lines. This makes them easier to print, but it can make following text across a large table difficult. Shading every other row really helps with this, and if you have the option of using this in your thesis then I'd recommend it.

As a biologist, I first started to use tables to provide large quantities of numbers. Tables of morphological measurements or meristics (counts). These were always tricky to put together in word processors, until they became better integrated with spreadsheets, and now it’s really easy to put these tables together and even format them in a spreadsheet and then cut and paste them into your word processor. 

Table: (\#tab:tables) **Some general dos and don'ts for tables**. There are exceptions for all of these, but if you can stick to them you are unlikely to go far wrong.

| **Do** | **Don't** |
|------|------|
| Use a table as a means of reducing the length of your text. |  Merge cells, especially in irregular ways, as this makes formatting and copy/paste of your table prone to errors. |
| Make your headings clear and concise. | Omit units of measurement |
| Summarise extensive data. | Try to include every data point (that's what [Supp Info](#suppInfo) is for). |
| Use tables to provide repeated statistical information on tests or models. | Feel the need to include all of these in the ms  (that's what [Supp Info](#suppInfo) is for). |
| Provide a full table legend that explains exactly what is in it (see [figures](#figures)). | Make tables so large that they have to run over several pages. If this can go into [Supp Info](#suppInfo) then it should. |
| Be adventurous by using tables to produces ideas, even with entire paragraphs of text or photographs. | Feel obliged to stick to using tables only for numbers. |
| Use shading for every other row. | Have rows or columns so close together that you can't tell them apart. |

# Supplementary Material {#suppinfo}

Twenty years ago, the idea of supplementary material for a journal article was practically unheard of. Today, it seems that few papers don’t have some supplementary material associated with them. Why this big change?

## What can go into Supplementary Material?
Practically anything can go into supplementary material.

- If you have lots of extra analyses that are too large to go into an article. 
- If your methods are extensive and there’s a word limit in the journal
- If your analytical tools throw out a bunch of super interesting graphics, but you can only use one or two
- Most of all, you can put in the raw data that makes up the basis for your work, together with the analytical script that you used to analyse it.

## Toward transparency and repeatability of scientific studies
This is a really positive movement in science and it should receive all of our support as it is part of the greater scientific project ([see part 2](#transparency)). Being proud of your work is being proud of the entire product, including the data and the analysis. If you felt they were good enough for peer review, then you should be happy to make them all freely available. Not sure if you haven’t made some mistakes? We all make mistakes and you shouldn’t think that you will have an entirely fault-free career. Whenever and wherever possible conduct your professional due diligence and be open and honest with your research. Science is a career when we should openly acknowledge errors and mistakes that we have made in the past. There’s no problem with this. Indeed, the problems only start when you refuse to acknowledge past errors and mistakes, making you prone to motivated reasoning and confirmation bias.

There are lots of data repositories out there. Some specialise in particular kinds of data, like genetic data in [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/), or sound data in [The Macaulay Library](https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/) at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Others are general repositories of data and you can post anything there, including the scripts that you used to analyse the data. By doing this you ensure that any people that want to use your work in the future have full access to it. Your data deposit will be given a [DOI](#DOI). You can use this [DOI](#DOI) in your publication so that readers know where to find the data. 

Once I happily allowed the publishers to store my data. These days, I simply don’t trust them to curate and keep my data for posterity. The way that most publishers of academic journals behave, there is no reason for them to make sure that my data is safe and secure. Therefore, I would rather go to an independent curator of data that specialises in not-for-profit data curation. One example is [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) which is built and operated by CERN and OpenAIRE. This site has the advantage that it is integrated with GitHub (if you are already a user, but check it out if you aren’t). You can choose to open your data immediately, or embargo it until your paper is published. It’s a great platform, and so much more secure than using a publisher. Another example is the [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/) that aims to be a one-stop shop for all of your storage needs. You will need to make sure that your data is correctly sorted with sufficient metadata for someone else to understand [see @roche2015public].

Once, we did statistical analysis with a GUI and a point and click approach. Forget to click a checkbox and the results were not repeatable. As the analyses have become increasingly sophisticated with more and differing pieces of software, it is becoming increasingly important to record the code that you write that gets your results together with your data. This is the difference between making your results and, therefore, your study repeatable. 

Talk to your advisor. Your lab or your institution may have a repository that they prefer.

## Why stop with just depositing your data and analyses online?
Let’s face it, you probably put a lot of effort into proposing your thesis hypotheses. Why not deposit this too? Remember that it does not have to be accessible to the world, but it would improve the integrity of your study if your original hypotheses are the same as the ones that you submit for publication. Some journals are now asking whether you have stored hypotheses ahead of conducting the experiments. They don’t stop you from submitting if you haven’t. But why not? It’s a great step forward in terms of transparency and provides more credibility when you eventually write that manuscript with the same aims. And it shouldn’t stop you from publishing another study that happened along the way, even though you hadn’t planned it. I suspect that in future funders will require us to deposit our successful funding proposals in an online repository before they release funds - hopefully, they’ll also be willing to support these facilities financially.

# Keeping track of your mental health {#mentalhealth}

Stress is a natural part of life, and many people are at their most productive when they are under some degree of pressure, such as a deadline. Although deadlines don’t work for everyone. Problems arise when we become overwhelmed by stress and are unable to fully respond. When this occurs productivity can drop off and survival responses can be triggered as if responding to an actual physical attack. These responses include fight, flight or freeze responses. Anxiety and panic can be triggered. In this state additional demands on your time may also push your life off balance, so that you start to neglect your personal wellbeing which can negatively impact on relationships, exercise regime, or even nutrition and personal hygiene. Some people can find that the additional stress can cause physical symptoms that may even need medical treatment. Your sense of competence and mastery can be negatively impacted such that you may even suffer from feelings of inadequacy or imposter syndrome. Impostor syndrome is an experience you have when you believe that you are not as competent as you think others perceive you to be. It is not uncommon in many professions, and especially prevalent in academia [@clance1978imposter]. This is now widely recognised and there are lots of useful shared experiences out there to read [e.g. @dickerson2019how; @woolston2016faking].

The General Health Questionnaire is an instrument used to measure psychological distress. For example, you could use the GHQ-12 [given in [Table 4.1](http://www.howtowriteaphd.org/healthy.html#tab:GHQ) in @measey2021how]. It is quick, reliable and simple to score, so you can use it at any time during your career as an indicator of whether you need to reach out to personal, occupational or professional support networks. My suggestion is that you complete a General Health Questionnaire now and record your answers as a baseline. Keep the scores somewhere safe. If you feel that you are getting overly stressed, take the test again and compare them with your baseline scores. Although there are no hard rules, if three or more of your scores have moved by two or more points it could be worth discussing with your support network to help you decide whether or not to seek professional help.  

Even if you don't feel you need the support of your institution now, it is worth finding out how they can support your mental health in the future if needed. Although there has been some stigma attached to difficulties with mental health in the past, most institutions accept that pressures are mounting on their staff and that they may require support. Most institutions will make experienced councillors available to support you if needed. Importantly, you should realise that none of these symptoms are unusual and that there is a high probability that many of your colleagues may also be struggling. Knowing that your problems are shared and reaching out to support networks early is an excellent way to prevent them from escalating beyond your control. Your best means of coping will be to try and develop a support network and to understand where and with whom you can discuss any difficulties as they arise. Knowing who this is and how and when to approach them will put you in a stronger position if you need them in future.

## Being physically active improves mental wellbeing

The positive relationship between the amount of physical activity and higher mental wellbeing is well established [e.g. @grasdalsmoen2020physical; @gerber2014increased], but the kind of exercise required to achieve this improved result is varied. There are plenty of studies out there that suggest there are multiple benefits from physical activity [@williams2021move]. This does not have to be the most hectic exercise possible. You'll get huge benefits from simply taking a walk.

Exercise does not exclude you from participating in other less physical activities, including mindfulness or meditation. Try different types of activities and then do what's right for you.

## Time to think

Use the time that you spend exercising as thinking time: turn ideas over in your head, think through the logic in arguments, and potential flaws in experimental design. If you can, spend this moving time with others in your group discussing projects and talking about ideas. There are reasons why we do some of our best thinking when physically active, and you should seek to exploit these when you can. For example, if you have a meeting scheduled then why not do it as a walk - even if it's on the university campus this walk will get you and your colleague in a much better space to plan ideas. 

This isn’t to say that you won’t need time at the computer writing it all down, or talking around a table with colleagues. Be inventive in how you spend your time, and don't resign yourself to spending all day sitting behind a desk. Don’t take my word for it, see this great new book by Caroline Williams [-@williams2021move].
