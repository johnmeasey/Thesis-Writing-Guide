This guide is pitched at postgraduate students, but is applicable to anyone who is writing scientific papers and wants to know more. It is not going to tell you what to write, but to open and examine the black box of scientific writing and publishing, and more broadly explore how this impacts the academic context. My intention is to demystify writing and publishing in the biological sciences, so that you will become aware of what to expect when you prepare to publish your thesis chapters. Class times and Venue In person classes will be held: Time: every Friday (from 3rd November to 29 December - 9 weeks) sessions 1 (8:30-9:15am) &amp; 2 (9:25-10:10am). Venue: Room 1211, Wenhui Building (Building 1), Chenggong Campus. Online activities and workshops: All online activities will be posted here in this guide. If you have difficulties accessing this site or any of the content, please let me know immediately. Within each online activity there are Exercises listed which are obligatory activities for every student. These must be individual to the student (no groups and no duplicate results). Course outline The philosophy of science – why we need to record what we do; standing on the shoulders of giants; publication The hypo-deductive model in science – big questions in your field; reviewing the literature; how to write a hypothesis; citing the literature A model for thesis writing – introduction; methods; results; discussion Nuts and bolts of writing – sentences; paragraphs; logical arguments; examples; citation databases When science goes wrong – publication bias; the evolution of bad science; rewards and retractions Preregistration – transparency; the movement for Open Science; data curation Publishing your thesis chapters – choosing a journal; preparing your submission; Open Access and reviewing models Peer Review – writing a rebuttal; how to conduct peer review; Your future in science – mental health; networks; careers Before you start Many of the exercises in this course will rely on you having an active research project that you are starting or working on. The idea is that you will use skills learned in this course directly on your own project. If you do not have a project, or your project is at such an early stage that you are unfamiliar with the literature, you should ask your advisor now for five papers that will be important for your project (preferably not all by them). If you don’t get five of your own papers, then you will be using five papers on topics that I choose: i.e. you will be working for me! It will be much better for you if you do the work in this course for yourself. Text books Depending on just how early you are in your career, there is a lot missing from this book that has been provided in two other books How to write a PhD in Biological Sciences and How to publish in the Biological Sciences. Those books should be consulted whenever you feel that you want more information - you should also consult articles, papers and other literature that is cited in this guide and those books. Whenever possible, I have put links to chapters in these other books. They have the look and feel of this guide, so watch out and don’t get lost! The course will be pulled from the two course texts: How to write a PhD in Biological Sciences: A guide for the uninitiated This is an Open Access book by John Measey, and published in 2022 by CRC Press, Boca Raton.

Acknowledgments There are a great many people that I need to thank. First and foremost are the members of my lab, past and present, who have inspired me to put together first the blog posts and then the book. It is because you wanted more that I put this together. This book contains lots of links to blogs and articles written and posted freely on the internet by others who also aim to demystify and help. I thank this greater academic community (especially #academicTwitter) for sharing and inspiring. Thanks go to the many reviewers and editors who have taken their time to improve my writing. I am still learning. Lots of the text in this book has been improved by feedback from my students and postdocs. A special mention must go to my brother, Richard, who has hosted my lab website for more than a decade, and especially for saving blog posts from hacking attacks. Thanks also to my wife, Thalassa, who proofread many of the blog posts after I had published them late at night, so that I could correct them over breakfast in the morning. James Baxter-Gilbert, Dan Bolnick, Jack Dougherty, Anthony Herrel, Allan Ellis, Rachael Lammey (CrossRef), Andrea Melotto, Lisa and Mark O’Connell, Ivan Oransky (Retraction Watch), Heather Piwowar (ImpactStory), Claire Riss (Center for Open Science), Johan Rooryck (cOAltition S), James Vonesh, Carla Wagener all read or commented on different aspects of the book. Thanks are also due to my colleagues at the Centre for Invasion Biology, the Department of Botany and Zoology, and Stellenbosch University. A special thanks to the librarians who have supported many of my more extreme rantings about publishers.

Once you know what the keywords are for your topic, you should be able to find most papers that are published on your topic with very little effort. Getting to know exactly what keywords will lead you to this state of nirvana is a little more complex. Nevertheless, this is a great place to start in your postgraduate journey. Also remember that keywords are dynamic and you can always modify and build your own collection. Perhaps most powerful of all are the ways in which you can use Boolean search terms or operators (see Table 2.1) to generate your exact keyword search. If you are not familiar with these operators (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) then it’s a good idea to read up on these now (see here). 2.1 Becoming familiar with the literature in your topic One of the most important aspects of getting started with your MSc or PhD is to be familiar with the literature on your topic. For the first week of our course we will investigate how to: Turning your topic into keywords Finding your keywords Visualising your keywords Set up an alert 2.2 Turning your topic into keywords For the first stage of this session, you will need to identify a topic. First choice is for you to use the topic that you are going to study for your MSc or PhD. If you do not have a topic, try asking (or writing to) your advisor for five papers that they think are key to your understanding of your topic. These should be original research papers (not reviews or opinion pieces) If you still have nothing, I have developed three potential topics for a MSc or PhD student and you will use one of these. You will find these here We will be working with literature databases. If you are not familiar with them, read the chapter here: https://howtowriteaphd.org/databases.html 2.2.1 Identify keywords for your study There are two sets of keywords for any published paper. Those provided by the authors and those automatically generated by each citation database. Be aware that some authors do not choose keywords well, which is why those generated by the citation database might be better. I suggest that you consider both. 2.2.1.1 Author selected keywords Every paper published comes with a list of key words that the authors have chosen. These are usually listed under the abstract of the paper (Figure 2.1). FIGURE 2.1: Finding the Keywords on a published paper. The author-selected keywords on each paper can usually be found listed under the abstract. 2.2.1.2 Database created keywords In addition to those listed by the authors, most databases automatically generate their own list of key words for each paper that they list. I am going to suggest that you keep lists of both of these separately. For the paper that you saw above, the key words listed on ISI Web-of-Science are shown in Figure 2.2). FIGURE 2.2: Finding the Keywords in a citation database. Both the author-selected keywords and those generated by the database are listed seperately under the abstract on each entry of each paper. That shown here is from the database Web of Science using Figure 2.1. 2.3 Exercise 1: Finding your keywords This exercise is to show you how to identify keywords for your own study. The keywords that you identify today should be useful for you moving forwards. But as you continue with your studies, you will find ways in which to add and modify your keyword searches. Some of these keywords will stay with you throughout your studies, others will change. The keyword search-string that you end up with will be dynamic. Take each paper you have been given and write down the key words into a spreadsheet with two headings: author keywords and keywords plus (or whatever the name is from your preferred database – Indexed Keywords in Scopus) If you already have papers that you have been given by your advisor, then start to make your list of key words from those listed on these papers Now take the next paper and do the same thing, adding to your list Now make a list of variables that you know you are going to measure during your study. These will be the defining variables that you use in your hypothesis. If you don’t know what they are yet, read the papers you have and see what variables they have in common and list these. If you really still don’t know what variables you will be using to measure the outcomes of your experiments, then you will need to come back to this section later in your postgraduate studies and update your keyword search once you know. You should now have two or three lists that are longer than the ones that appear in Figure 2.3) If you feel that you don’t have enough keywords, use your literature database to search through the citations to each of the papers that you were given. From this list, choose the most appropriate papers, and record their keywords into your list. FIGURE 2.3: Creating your own list of keywords from different sources. In this example, I have listed the keywords from the example in Figure 2.1 2.3.1 Curating your keyword database Now that you have a keyword database, you need to go through it and make sure that all of the contents are still on topic. Here are some pointers about what to keep and what to delete. In this first set of keywords, you are looking for a list total of 10 to 20. If you cannot reduce these sufficiently, then do your best. add any obvious keywords that you think are missing from the previous exercise if you are interested in particular taxa (species, genera or families) add a separate column to include these Remove any duplicates delete any keywords that you feel really do not apply to your topic delete geopolitical names - like country names or administrative regions. Including geopolitical names might cause you to narrow your search too much, missing important papers coming from overseas, so it is better to remove these names 2.3.2 Learning about Boolean operators Now we are going to use our keywords to make a search in a literature database. Go to your chosen database and use each list of keywords with Boolean AND between them and Boolean OR among groups. More detailed information on Boolean operators is available here. Table 2.1 shows the typical Boolean operators and their meanings. TABLE 2.1: Boolean operators and examples of how to use them. Boolean operators are of pivotal importance when combining your search terms. Examples are taken from Figure 2.1. Boolean operator Function Example AND Results that contains both keywords occupancy AND detection OR Results that contain either keyword temperature OR altitude NOT Results that contain one keyword but and the other temperature NOT altitude Quotation marks “ ” Results with the exact phrase “time to hatching” Brackets ( ) Encapsulates a search topic (occupancy AND detection) NOT (temperature OR altitude) Wildcard: * can substitute the end of words invasi* will give results for invasive, invasion, invasions, invasiveness, etc. Wildcard: ? can substitute a letter inside a word sterili?e will give results for sterilize and sterilise Wildcard: $ can substitute more than one letter inside a word colo$r will give results for color and colour 2.3.3 Wildcards Most literature databases allow you to search using different wildcards. These are *, $ and ?. These can be placed at any point within a search term and help overcome differences in spelling, or families of words that you may want to capture or exclude in your search. Use * when you want to replace a set of letters at the end of a word. For example, reptil* will return all terms including Reptilia, reptile and reptiles. Use ? when you want to search for any single letter at that place in a word. For example, sterili?e will capture words with sterilize and sterilise. Use $ when there is more than a single letter that might change within a word, or the omission of a letter. For example, colo$r will return both US and UK spelling, color and colour, respectively. Note that Scopus doesn’t use the $ symbol as a wildcard: for this example you can use ? instead. 2.3.3.1 Use of brackets The most powerful use of Boolean operators is when you combine your keywords and operators into brackets. Brackets allow you to produce a string of alternative keywords together (using OR) and then join them with another group of keywords (using AND). At the same time, you can exclude a whole group of papers that keep popping up in your searches (like those in human health). Taking the results from our example above, we can conduct a simple Boolean search using all the keywords mentioned for each of the topics. This is a very restrictive way of searching, and we would expect that it would results in a very small set of results (and it does N = 86), and they are not particularly helpful. The point here is that you can think of this example as a way of using brackets. FIGURE 2.4: A simple way to use Boolean operators in a search term. In this example, I have taken the keywords from Figure 2.2) and used a simple AND operator between them. This means that for this search, the papers need to have all the keywords listed in each row, OR those listed in the next row. If you wrote out this sample example using brackets (for Web of Science) it would look like this: TS=(\"detection probability\" AND \"model-based sampling\" AND occupancy AND species distribution) OR TS=(VALIDATION AND OCCUPANCY AND SURVEYS AND \"POPULATION DISTRIBUTIONS\") OR TS=(temperature AND altitude AND \"time to hatching\" AND \"eggs laid\") Note that here TS (meaning TOPIC is abbreviated to TS= before each set of bracketed terms). Using this kind of term, you can use the Advanced Search Query Builder to build your search term. Try this now: 1. Copy and paste the above term into the Advanced Search Query Builder and see what results you get 1. Next try these second and third advanced search terms (below) and see what results you get 1. What has changed between these two search terms and why are they so very different? 1. Which do you think will be the most useful, and why? 1. All of the search terms have remained the same, so how has the use of brackets changed this Advanced Search Query Builder? TS=(\"detection probability\" OR \"model-based sampling\" OR occupancy OR species distribution) AND TS=(VALIDATION OR OCCUPANCY OR SURVEYS OR \"POPULATION DISTRIBUTIONS\") AND TS=(temperature OR altitude OR \"time to hatching\" OR \"eggs laid\") TS=(\"detection probability\" OR \"model-based sampling\" OR occupancy OR species distribution OR VALIDATION OR OCCUPANCY OR SURVEYS OR \"POPULATION DISTRIBUTIONS\") AND TS=((temperature OR altitude) AND (\"time to hatching\" OR \"eggs laid\")) 2.3.3.2 Use of Field Tags In the above search term TS is a field tag for Topic which includes anything in the Title, Abstract or Keywords. If you only wanted to search within the keywords, you could use AK (author keywords) or KP (keywords plus) (see Table 2.2). There are a lot more Field Tags that you can use to narrow or broaden your search. Some of these are listed below for Web of Science. TABLE 2.2: Field Tags (from Web of Science) and some examples of how to use them. You can use any of these Field Tags to further refine your search, and it’s easy to set up an alert once you’ve found an advanced search query that works well for you (see below). *If you want to search within a range of dates, you need to add this in addition to your advanced search term (underneath). Field Tag use example TS TS=Topic TS=(\"detection probability\" OR \"model-based sampling\") TI TI=Title TI=(\"model-based sampling\" OR occupancy) AB AB=Abstract AB=(occupancy OR species distribution) AK Author Keywords AK=(\"time to hatching\" OR \"eggs laid\") KP KP=Keyword Plus® KP=(VALIDATION OR OCCUPANCY OR SURVEYS) PY PY=Year Published* PY = 2010 2.3.4 Polishing your choice of keywords So far we have used combinations of existing keywords to make searches that provide us with lots of results in our literature database. In order to find the best advanced search term, you now need to look at the resulting output of your searches. Step 1 Choose an advanced search term that has generated ~1000 outputs. Next look through these outputs and see whether the titles are relevant to your topic. All five of your starting references (see here) should be present in this output. Looking at all of the content, choose the most relevant five publications (that you really want to read) that are not in your original five. Look at their keywords and see how they match your search term. Use any of these additional keywords to refine your advanced search term to see whether you can improve your search. Go back to the beginning of this list and keep refining and polishing your search term so that: There are between approximately 500 and 1500 results More than 95% of the results are relevant to your topic You aren’t getting anything more interesting Step 2 If your search results look uninteresting or irrelevant to your study topic then something has gone wrong with your advanced search term, and you need to look at it again. Look through everything the entire output and make two lists of those that are relevant and those that are not Look through the output of relevant papers and decide on the best 5 which should be exactly what you want, but not in the list that you input above it is the combination of keywords that are important here. Make a new list with these combinations. In addition, list each of the keywords of each of these papers found. and those that are of no interest see which keywords are being flagged up most frequently in each of these groups. Some keywords and combinations are going to be too general to be useful. You can delete these from your lists. You should have some new keywords and some that have been removed. There should be less than 10 in total. If not, then you need to repeat the steps again until you feel more confident about which keywords are getting you the results that you want. Step 3 In the next step, you are going to rank your keywords into those that you think are most relevant and those you think are least. Now you are going to take the top 5 and enter them into the literature database with Boolean AND between them. This should give you a very small list (~20) but with everything in it being what you really want to read. If not, then go back to the previous step and refine your keywords again Next you need to change your Boolean operators from AND to OR between some of these keywords. Use your knowledge of the subject to decide what to try first. What we are looking for is a good combination of AND and OR operators so that we get around 1000 results. Looking through the first 100 results should give you lots of titles where you want to read the abstracts (or at least recognize that they are relevant to your study). 2.4 Exercise 2: Visualising your keywords In this exercise we are going to use the output of Exercise 1 to visualise these keywords in a network. This will help us: discover more and relevant keywords see how keywords change over time learn which keywords are synonymous find out which authors are associated with which topics FIGURE 2.5: The output from Exercise 1. In this example, I polished my keywords from Exercise 1 until I found a relevant combination that produced around 1500 results. Note that Yunnan University subscription of WoS does not allow exporting of keywords and citations, so we cannot use it here. From here on, we will use Scopus. You will need to familiarise yourself with Scopus, and learn how to recreate your search term in this literature database. 2.4.1 Export your results: Scopus: All &gt; Export &gt; Bibiographic Infor AND Citation Info | in batches of 2000. If you need to export more than one file, make sure to choose the same fields and combine your results before moving on. FIGURE 2.6: Exporting the output from Exercise 1 using Scopus. Here I have selected the Citation information and Abstract &amp; keywords to be downloaded in CSV file format. 2.4.2 Making a visualisation network We are going to use software called VOSViewer. You should read the following chapter before you continue to get some background on how to use VOSViewer here. Download VOSViewer here Once you have downloaded and installed VOSViewer on your computer, you can follow the following steps: Open VOSViewer and go to Map &gt; Create Create map based on bibliographic data Read data from bibliographic database files Select Scopus and find your file saved above Select co-occurrence and author keywords Explore selecting different types of analyses and counting methods in VOSViewer Save your keyword output network NB If you don’t have the option to select keywords, then you may not have exported your citations with keywords. See Figure 2.6) and try again. The first output created (Figure 2.7) shows us how different keywords are connected. Stronger connections between keywords are shown with thicker lines. You should see all of the keywords that you used in your advanced search term here, and possibly some more. Take a note of any additional keywords (especially if they are large with many thick connections), and consider adding them to your search term. FIGURE 2.7: An output using author keywords from Exercise 1 using VOSViewer. Different parts of the network that are most connected are grouped with different colours. This provides you with insight about which keywords are connected. You may wish to include these as search terms within brackets. From this and my original selection I choose the most relevant keywords. For example, here I will not select ‘reptiles’ or ‘forest management’ as my topic is not relevant to this. On the other hand, ‘detection probability’ is a very important keyword for my topic. Next, use the tab ‘Overlay Visualisation’ to see how different aspects of this topic are important. In the next visualisation (Figure 2.8), we will see how the year of publication impacts what keywords are used. We should consider adding these keywords if they are relevant to the study. If keywords look unfamiliar to you, then it might be worth reading some of the papers concerned and if you still don’t understand if they are relevant then discuss it with your advisor. FIGURE 2.8: An output using author keywords from Exercise 1 using VOSViewer. Note that the most recent subjects (yellow) are ‘eDNA’ and ‘chytridomycosis’. VOSViewer makes it easy to change the different Visualization Scores to reveal different aspects of your downloaded dataset. FIGURE 2.9: An output using author keywords from Exercise 1 using VOSViewer. Note that most citations come from papers on anurans with detection probability, site occupancy and monitoring – but beware – older publications have more citations, so rather use ‘avg. norm. citations’ which takes account of the age of each publication. In Figure 2.9, those publications with keywords in yellow are generating the most citations. This can give you some idea of what combinations of topics are most interesting to a wider audience, especially when they are more recent (see Figure 2.8). 2.4.3 Answer the following questions: How does using VOSViewer to visualise your keyword network in Exercise 2 add to what you have already done in Exercise 1? Do you need to rethink your advanced search terms now that you have visualised your results? What other ways do you think would be able to help refine your advanced search term? 2.5 Exercise 3: Setting up an alert For this you will need to register with an account in one of the literature databases. Let’s look here at Scopus as they appear to have more services for Yunnan University. FIGURE 2.10: To set your alert up in Scopus, click on the bell icon. You will have to be logged in to set an alert, so set up your account if you haven’t done so already Here I have set up an alert for the query shown in both Exercise 1 and Exercise 2. Every Monday I will receive an email when new papers come out that fit these search criteria. FIGURE 2.11: Stipulate the notifications for your alert. You can choose when you want your alert, and to which email address it should be sent. 2.6 Summing up the keywords workshop In this workshop, we have concentrated on finding literature that you should be reading in order to catch up and stay relevant with your own topic. If you have not been able to use your own topic for this workshop, then you still need to do this once you get enough information on your subject. Bookmark this page and make sure that you come back. If you have now set up an alert as a result of doing this workshop, then you will start to receive emails alerting you to new literature. There are still some important action points: Add the final set of literature that result from your best search term to your reference manager In your reference manager make notes of what you want to read and make sure that you have access (see here) When reading these papers that you have found, remember to read critically Unless you read any of the literature that you have found, there will be no point in having found it - so please read it! This is the end of this workshop on Keywords. If you find any problems with this workshop, please be sure to let me know.

Citations are a means of recognising that your work is built on the work of others. They are part of the fundamental tenets of science that we don’t start from nothing each time we conduct a study. Names of three or more authors are frequently reduced to ‘et al.’ (often written in italics: et al.) which is short for the Latin et alia, meaning ‘and others’. 3.3 Dunleavy’s 7 criteria for academic research Defining attributes of academic work What the attribute means The related role of citations and referencing Formally stated Premises and assumptions are explicit, and arguments are precisely expressed To specify sources for assumptions and their contextual legitimacy, and to contextualise arguments within a defined field Part of an advanced conversation Academic work expresses a lot of content in a brief space, using specialist terminology or notations To set up a specialist discourse in an economical and highly-focused manner, and to show how the relevant literature defines concepts, terms or notations Cumulative Arguments are built up layer by layer To show that the author has read the relevant literature and has a good understanding of it Tackling difficult issues Academic work goes beyond common-sense understandings and (generally) seeks theory-based and non-obvious explanations of complex, hard-to-understand phenomena To guide readers seeking to follow the author’s extended chain of reasoning. Readers should be able to understand and “replay” the intellectual journey involved Collegial Professionals carefully accord credit to other authors where it is due. STEM disciplines assign special emphasis to those who are first in discovering or correctly understanding phenomena (primacy) To accurately assign credit to other researchers for key innovations and relevant prior findings or arguments, so that readers can also access this work for themselves Evidence-based Arguments are grounded in proofs, recorded facts, or other auditable tokens. The provenance of all claims should be checkable To allow readers to quickly find and precisely check sources of evidence or other tokens for themselves. An extended version of this criterion, now dominant in more and more STEM and social sciences fields, is that all published work should include a replication archive with data and guidance to make it reproducible Empirically consistent Evidence and arguments are related to other views or findings, and divergences are explained. In STEM subjects there is a general premium on considering all scientific evidence on the exact same topic, carried through most strongly in “systematic review”. Elsewhere this criterion is often more loosely interpreted To show that the author has comprehensively surveyed work that is relevant in scope, approach and recency, and to specifically point out consistencies and inconsistencies between other work and the author’s own findings Taken from Dunleavy, P.

In this section, we will take a look at how to build a hypothesis. This is a sticking point for many students. We are used to using and writing questions and statements in day-to-day communications, as well as reading popular media. But hypotheses (the plural of hypothesis) very rarely come into regular conversations. So how do we write one, and how do we know if our hypothesis is good? In addition to this section, there is some good information out there on the web, and it’s worth looking at this too: (e.g. Wikihow, Wikipedia, etc.). There’s also some less good stuff out there, so read critically. If you know of some really good sites in your language, then please let me know so that I can share them here. 4.1 Aims of this workshop In this workshop, you will find three exercises that aim to help you: find the hypothesis being tested in a research paper determine the components that make up the hypothesis and see how they are introduced evaluate the hypothesis and determine whether or not it meets the criteria of having independent variables, a mechanism supported by the literature, and if it is falsifiable In each of these exercises you will need to use the five research papers that you used in previous exercises (see here). You should now be getting used to the idea that these five papers are going to be very important in this course, and that the more relevant they are to your own project, the more useful the course will be to you. 4.1.1 What is a hypothesis? A hypothesis is a statement of your research intent. It tells the reader, what you plan to do in your research. But there’s a little more to it than this. The hypothesis becomes a part of the scientific method as it is testable and (importantly) falsifiable, and it is informed from previously published work on the subject. By building and refuting hypotheses in the biological sciences, we can eventually establish theories that unify sets of hypotheses that have not been falsified (see Figure 4.1). Although they are absent in the biological sciences, universal laws come from theories that can logically be shown to be correct in every circumstance. However, a fundamental part of all science is that both theories and laws are ultimately refutable. FIGURE 4.1: Working with hypotheses is the only way toward generating working theories. Although universal laws are only considered in mathematics and physics, we still use theories in the biological sciences. The best way towards establishing more useful theories is through working to refute hypotheses. Your hypothesis must be informed by the literature, which is why you will spend so much time and effort crafting your introduction to inform your reader about all the components of your hypothesis. This is also why your hypothesis usually comes at the end of your introduction, because you spend all of the introduction telling your reader about it. There’s not much point in writing more after the hypothesis, because once your reader has read that, they are ready to learn about how you went about testing it (in the Materials &amp; Methods). The other important point to make is that the literature should dictate how you write your hypothesis, and the variables that you include. If, for example, you think that temperature is the most important variable for your hypothesis, but all of the literature suggests that it is oxygen, you can’t ignore oxygen and you should also frame your hypothesis using this variable (you can have more than one hypothesis after all!). In this case, you will also need to provide a sufficient introduction to temperature (using a logical argument and sufficient literature) as a variable to justify its inclusion in your hypothesis. Perversely, your aim is not to prove that your idea is right, but to show that the hypothesis can be refuted. Progress is achieved through falsification of incorrect theories We try to write a hypothesis that is falsifiable: i.e. you can prove (usually using statistical tests) that it is not correct (or at least show that the likelihood that it is correct is very low). That’s why it is conventional to provide the ‘null hypothesis’ that is the falsified version of the statement, suggesting that there is no relationship between the variables you have proposed to measure. The convention is to label this ‘null hypothesis’ H0, while the ‘alternative hypothesis’ (the one that says your variables are related as you suggested) is written as H1. When you formulate your hypothesis, it is traditional to write your alternative hypothesis to indicate the directionality of your tested variables. This way, the reader can simply imply that the null hypothesis is when there is no relationship, but this will need to be stated if the null hypothesis is more complex. Karl Popper (2005) was the philosopher who proposed that without being able to refute or falsify a scientific problem, it ceases to be scientific. This is the reason for our null hypothesis. If the null is not available as a possible outcome, then logically, there is no science. Karl Popper (2005): “…it must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience”. It is worth noting here that rejecting the alternative hypothesis, or accepting the null hypothesis, does not mean that you have proved your null hypothesis (Altman and Bland 1995). Using the same logic described above, testing your hypothesis has two potential outcomes: showing that the hypothesised relationship is likely to exist (accepting H1), or rejecting this relationship (rejecting H1). The other way of thinking of this is the widely used adage: Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Most importantly, your hypothesis must come first, before you do the experiment or study. Hence the reason why this section comes at the start of part 2. Setting the hypothesis after the work is already done is fraudulent, and goes against the scientific method. Obviously, it isn’t fair to pose the hypothesis once you already know the answer (also known as HARKing). This is why there is so much emphasis put on formulating your hypothesis during your research proposal. Getting it right will determine what you do and how you test it. If you think of an extra hypothesis that would be really useful to test once you’ve already done your study, you can conduct a post hoc test, but this should have more stringent levels of statistical assessment. 4.1.2 How your hypothesis fits into the greater scientific community It is important to understand that hypotheses that you tests in your studies will ultimately become part of the wisdom of the greater scientific community, and ultimately the society at large (Figure 4.2). Of course, if you never publish your results, your work cannot be considered towards or against competing theories. Similarly, if you don’t read the recent literature, then you won’t be aware of what hypotheses have recently been tested and further how proposed theories are shaping up. FIGURE 4.2: Hypotheses that you generate and test will join the community of evidence in the greater scientific community if published. When you publish chapters from your thesis, they enter into a community of knowledge (grey oval) held by the larger scientific community. This knowledge can be used to support or refute theories. The feedback from this larger body of evidence should come back into helping you generate more hypotheses for your own work. Writing a hypothesis isn’t easy, but it is essential, and once you’ve understood what to do most of the rest of what you are writing for should make sense. 4.1.3 What a hypothesis isn’t It is not a question and so should never have a question mark after it. It isn’t a simple prediction: if this then that. You will see on the internet that hypotheses are explained in this simple predictive framework. I say that a hypothesis is not a simple prediction because it lacks the mechanistic and scholarly aspect of a good hypothesis, which is what we want to achieve. 4.2 Exercise 1: Spotting the hypothesis in a paper Finding the hypothesis in a published paper should be an easy exercise. As we will see, there is a tradition that they hypothesis comes in the last paragraph of the introduction. However, there is no rule, so you might need to hunt around for it. I would hope that most authors actively advertise their hypotheses so that it is clearly indicated as such somewhere in the introduction. In this exercise, you will take the five research papers that you selected for your keywords exercise and write down the hypothesis or hypotheses that are presented in each paper. Then, using what you have collected, answer the following questions: Are all of the statements hypotheses? (Are any of them questions or predictions?) Is it the null hypothesis (H0) or the alternative hypothesis (H1) that is given? How many hypotheses are presented in each paper? Does each hypothesis relate to a different experiment? 4.3 A formulaic way to start writing your hypothesis: “If. then. because.” A simple way to consider making your hypothesis is to adopt an “If. then. because.” construction where you add in your problem statement using your independent variable after ‘if’, and your prediction using your dependent variable after ‘then’, and finally the expected mechanism after ‘because’. For example, using the “If. then. because.” construction, we might hypothesise: “If environmental temperatures in which tadpoles develop are increased then tadpole development rate is faster because they follow the classic metabolism of ectotherms”. Both independent variable (temperature) and dependent variable (tadpole development rate) are present in this hypothesis, and the predicted relationship between them is clear. In addition, the causal mechanism is stated. This is a formulaic way to start writing your hypothesis, because it usually ends up as an inelegant statement, which can be better refined for a reader. A citation for your stated mechanism might also help clarify exactly where the justification for this comes from. More examples of “If. then. because.” are shown in Figure (4.3). FIGURE 4.3: If… then… because… is a formulaic way in which to start writing your hypothesis. The crucial parts that are required are all present including the variables that you control (independent variables), the measured variables (dependent variable), and the causal mechanism. The fabricated examples here are shown to help you get started. Remember that once you have your If. then. because. statement, you will need to refine it and add a citation for the known causal mechanism. 4.3.1 Dependent and independent variables It is important to know what your variables are (Table 4.1). Choosing variables to manipulate and those to measure are going to depend on the literature; i.e., what other people have tried and found effective before. TABLE 4.1: The variables inside your hypothesis. It is critical to be aware of all salient variables in your hypothesis and whether you will change or control them. The two main types of variables, Dependent and Independent, are also known as (aka) other names. Variable name aka Variable description Graphically Dependent Response, Outcome The variable that you will measure to see how your treatments have changed it. Shown on the y-axis Independent Determinate, Predictor, Explanatory The variable that you will deliberately change and control in your experiment or sampling regime Shown on the x-axis Co-variate Co-variable An variable that is not of interest but that can influence the measurement of the dependent variable - Random variable - An variable whose value is unknown but can influence the measurement of the dependent variable - 4.3.2 What kind of mechanism are you using? Mechanisms (or causal explanations) fall into three main areas: endogenous, exogenous and evolutionary (Allen and Baker 2017). 4.3.2.1 Endogenous causal explanations Endogenous causal explanations focus on the mechanisms happening inside an organism, such as physiological processes, hormones, reproductive state, etc. 4.3.2.2 Exogenous causal explanations Exogenous causal explanations concern mechanisms that are outside the body of individuals. Common exogenous mechanisms are climatic factors (temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc.) or may relate to the availability of food, predators or mates. 4.3.2.3 Evolutionary causal explanations These mechanisms have evolved through time, and often relate to exogenous mechanisms triggering endogenous processes over multiple generations. Note then that the above mechanisms are not mutually exclusive in their nature, and it may be useful to combine different approaches within biology to ask hypotheses across all of these levels. Mechanisms in biological sciences are rarely simple or act on multiple organismal levels, so designing a controlled experiment in order to test a specific mechanism thoroughly can be very demanding. In other words, can you be sure that the cause is really responsible for the effect that you are measuring? A good hypothesis will often take an existing hypothesis further, to try to better refine the knowledge on a subject. Hence, it is perfectly acceptable to state that you are building on existing hypotheses (and giving the appropriate statement) when making your own. 4.3.3 Teleological versus causal hypotheses A teleological argument refers to the reason or a purpose of a particular process. For example, you may measure vertical migration of water fleas and suggest that diurnal migrations are made because the water fleas want to avoid predation. This is a teleological hypothesis because you are suggesting that the reason behind a process is the desire by water fleas to avoid predators. Although a reduction of predation may be a consequence of vertical migration in water fleas, each water flea does not think about predation and then starts it’s upward movement as a result. A common mistake made in biology is to apply teleological arguments to processes that have no purpose or reason. Evolution is often mistakenly suggested to have a purpose (e.g. to evolve to a more advanced state), but in fact, evolution is not a goal-orientated process. There is no end-point to evolution, and evolution did not start in order to meet some predetermined form or function. On the other hand, a causal hypothesis focuses on the factors about A that cause B. You should have realised that biologists are principally interested in causal hypotheses, because most mechanisms that are studied in biological sciences have no predetermined goal. If you are a behavioural ecologist, then you will need to be particularly aware of these two types of hypotheses, and when teleological explanations may be appropriate: many types of behaviour are goal orientated. 4.3.4 Tinbergen’s (1963) four questions In his (1963) paper, Tinbergen posed four questions that he showed could be answered independently of each other, but that together could explain any observed biological trait. These questions are often laid out on a grid (Table 4.2) as this shows how they are pieced together to provide an explanation of the trait. TABLE 4.2: Tinbergen’s (1963) four questions. Stemming from his seminal paper On aims and methods of ethology, Tinbergen’s four questions are widely believed to be of use in addressing the study any biological trait. - Contemporary Chronicle Proximate Mechanism: What is the anatomical or physiological structure of the trait? Ontogeny: How does the trait develop in individuals? Ultimate Adaptive value: Why has the function of the trait influenced fitness? Phylogeny: What is the phylogenetic history that led to the trait? Note that the first two questions are both proximate in that they explain the structure of the trait and its developed. The last two questions are evolutionary (or ultimate), to determine how the trait is influenced by selection. Although Tinbergen (1963) originally conceived these questions to explore behavioural traits, these four questions are used more widely as big ideas that enable biologists to determine proximate and ultimate causes of any trait that they wish to study, either independently of each other, or in synthesis to provide an overall picture. If you haven’t done so already, it would be worth spending time to determine how many of Tinbergen’s four questions have been answered for your own study system. 4.4 Exercise 2: Breaking down a hypothesis In this exercise, I want you to take the hypotheses that you recorded in Exercise 1 and work through the following set of objectives: Re-write each hypothesis into the form: “If… then… because…” Which is the dependent variable and which is independent? (Hint: If you have difficulty knowing this from the introduction, you can easily determine this from the Materials and Methods section) Once you have identified the components in each hypothesis, go back to the introduction and highlight where these three components (Dependent variable, Independent variable and mechanism) were introduced. Write out the missing (H0 or H1) hypothesis. Classify each hypothesis as endogenous, exogenous or evolutionary. Can you fit any of the hypotheses into one of Tinbergen’s four questions? What are the big ideas that these studies add evidence towards? (Hint: We will use this answer again in week 4) You should be able to determine 4.4.1 The problem of independence Probably one of the hardest issues that you will face in biological sciences is to determine whether your dependent variable is reliant only on the independent variable of choice. For example, a lot of variance in biological sciences will relate to the climate (especially with global change studies), but if the independent variable is temperature, this means that all other climatic variables must be kept the same. That is, if temperature is your independent variable, it is the only variable that can change in your experiment. This type of experiment is challenging as temperature often affects other variables (especially that they may vary in an unpredictable way). As soon as you have more than one independent variable, you can no longer test your dependent variable because you don’t know which independent variable it is reacting to. Isolating variables is notoriously difficult, especially when we move from the laboratory to the field. A classic approach to this is to consider additional variables as co-variates. A co-variate is not the variable of interest, but may change the dependent variable in your experimental design (Table 4.1). There are statistical ways to account for co-variates. You will need to think very carefully about what variables other than those of interest are potentially impacted by your experimental design. If you cannot control for them, this will likely mean that you may need to change your hypothesis, or change your experimental design to take account of these co-variates. If you are unsure, then I would encourage you to look carefully at the experiments that others have conducted in the literature. You always need to know how you are going to analyse your results when you plan your experiment. Hence, ensuring that the analysis is accounting for all variables and co-variables and that these are all controlled for your chosen mechanism is a difficult but essential component of your hypothesis building exercise. 4.5 Exercise 3: evaluating a hypothesis How do you decide whether or not a hypothesis is good? To do this, you might think that you need plenty of experience (and yes, that does help). But really, you just need to look for the elements that are discussed above. So once you’ve written your hypothesis, try to objectively answer the questions below: Is there a clear prediction with a mechanism (if. then. because)? Is the mechanism supported by the literature? Is the hypothesis testable/falsifiable? Does the hypothesis use concise wording and precise terminology? Does the prediction use independent and dependent variables correctly? Consider each of the hypotheses from your example papers, and ask each of the questions above. Question Were all of the parts of a hypothesis present? If not, then can you identify the missing parts of re-write an improved hypothesis for this paper? Question How similar are the hypotheses presented to any of the hypotheses that you plan to test? Will you be using any of the same variables or mechanisms? 4.6 Summing up this hypothesis workshop In this workshop, we have concentrated on the hypothesis as the central part of any research project. Of course, it is possible to conduct a scientific project without a hypothesis (see here), but you should now appreciate why your research will be stronger if it is falsifiable. You will have learned how to: find the hypothesis being tested in a research paper determine the components that make up the hypothesis and see how they are introduced evaluate the hypothesis and determine whether or not it meets the criteria of having independent variables, a mechanism supported by the literature, and if it is falsifiable To take this forwards, you should now be thinking about how to formulate the hypotheses that you want to use in your own studies, From what you already know, gather together the variables of interest (you should go back and look at the keywords that you previously generated). Ask yourself: Has the hypothesis that interests you has been asked before? If so, how is yours different? If not, what are examples of similar hypotheses that have been asked? Does your hypothesis meet the criteria we have set out? If not, what can you change? This is the end of this workshop on hypothesis building.

For most of us, it takes a lot of hard work over many weeks or even months to write something that can be submitted. Sometimes it seems that every paper I read is just repeating the same formula over and over again. I even tend to forget that it’s there until someone breaks the mould. Breaking the mould produces papers that really stand out, captivating the reader straight away. So why aren’t we writing those novel manuscripts every time we write a paper? Moreover, why don’t we teach students to write stand-out papers that will captivate everyone. Should we really be teaching formulaic writing? Here I argue that not only is writing to a formula good practice, but it’s the best way to learn scientific writing. When you look to see who is writing those knock-out articles (i.e. “broken mould”), the answer is that they are really experienced researchers who have written hundreds of papers, and (unlike some of us) in doing so have learnt the essence of great writing. Such greatness is not innate and comes rarely to any researchers (even those who have written hundreds of papers). That’s why I suggest to my students that they follow the formulas that are by now well recorded in many blogs and websites on scientific writing. There is another reason why writing to a formula is recommended. Not only is it easier, but because it is so common and widespread, it also gives the reader a familiarity with reading your work. This means that editors are able to skim through and find exactly what makes your work worth publishing, and it means that those who are only semi-interested are more likely to find what they need to cite in your work. In this workshop you will learn: the typical formula for a paper in the natural sciences how to spot formula in your key papers plan your paragraphs in the introduction and discussion turn formula plans into paragraph plans 7.1 So what is the formula? If we were in my office, at this point in the meeting I usually go to my white board and start drawing funnels (as a metaphor) and blocks. However, others have much better diagrams and here I’ve adapted an idea from Brian McGill’s blog (2016). But you can also find other useful material in other papers Tomaska (2007). If you are of the Twitter persuasion, you get lots of useful tips and links from WriteThatPhD and Write4Research. The diagram below (Figure 7.1) is supposed to show the movement of a liquid medium from one vessel to another. This is to make you think of your readers’ understanding moving fluidly from one section to another. The introduction concentrates the ideas into your particular approach, while the discussion allows the reader to understand how your results fit into the larger body of knowledge. FIGURE 7.1: Using a formulaic approach to writing your MSc or PhD chapter. This diagram represents the formula of writing a paper or chapter that we will concentrate on in this book. Imagine the flow of the reader being like a liquid that passes from one section to the next. 7.1.1 The hypothesis at the heart of the formula Having made the point that the formula is funnelling the readers’ interest, the question arises: to what? What are we working towards? Why are we so interested in having the reader focus on a particular thing, and more importantly: what is that thing? The Hypothesis Your hypothesis is the reason that you are conducting your study. You are trying to respond to it, trying to accept or reject it. Your hypothesis is why you are doing the study and you need your reader to get the context for this, and to understand exactly why it was that you posed this specific hypothesis. The hypothesis is then at the heart of everything that you write in your chapter (Figure 7.2): Your introduction explains why you posed the hypothesis Your methods &amp; materials describe how you went about testing your hypothesis Your results provide the outcome of the tests of your hypothesis Your discussion responds to your hypothesis and provides the context FIGURE 7.2: Your hypothesis lies at the heart of your MSc or PhD chapter. Your hypothesis (red star) is at the heart of everything that you are writing about. The entire reason for providing the chapter is to test your idea. 7.2 Exercise 1: Spotting the formula in others’ writing In this exercise we are going to take the 5 papers that were identified at the beginning of this course (see here). You can either print out these papers and work with coloured highlighter pens, or you can use the pdf versions in Acrobat Reader. NB: If one or more of your papers are reviews, this exercise may not work for them. We will deal with literature reviews in another component of this course (here). Using the introduction, we will summarise each paragraph into the generalisations of Figure 7.3. Here I have taken a paper from the Keyword Topics by Fontaine and Kohl (Fontaine and Kohl 2020). FIGURE 7.3: De-constructing a published paper to spot the formula. In this paper by Fontaine and Kohl (Fontaine and Kohl 2020) I have highlighted each paragraph in the introduction and broken it down into the formula given in Figure 7.1. In this example, the theme is climate change, the topic is the microbiome, they key variable is temperature and the study system are two anuran species. But to keep it general I will use the words: theme, topic, variable, study system. Pink: Overview of importance of topic including key variables. Example of key variable and impact on topic Prediction of theme on topic and key variable Orange: Identification of gap in knowledge concerning key variable and topic structured argument with examples on key variable resulting in changes to topic Introduction of second variable of interest Yellow: Potential confounding factors on variables Structured argument with examples to justify study system Concluding justification of study system Green: Explanation of experimental approach Introduction to study system Statement of hypothesis Insight into results It was relatively straightforward to determine each of the components (above) from reading the text. This is a relatively short introduction, and yours maybe longer. However, I would like you to conduct this breakdown of each introduction in each of your five papers. Question What are the key differences between this example and a typical introduction formula (see Table: (#tab:intro))? Question How has the move from five paragraphs to four impacted the distribution of the contents of the introduction (see Table: (#tab:intro))? Question How much variation do you see of the typical introduction formula (see Table: (#tab:intro)) compared to the five that you have chosen to look at? 7.3 Exercise 2: Where are the different aspects introduced? Almost every paper has different aspects, each of which requires an introduction. These aspects are: theme This is the big idea that the study fits within. Most studies cannot directly study an entire theme, but only one topic within it. Examples of themes are: evolution, climate change, conservation, ecology topic This is a sub-discipline of the theme that usually determines that approach that you have taken to study the theme variable These are the units of measure and manipulation in the study study system This can be a cell, an organ, a species, a group of species, or an ecological system hypothesis The question that the study is designed to answer For each of your five papers, I want you to name each of the aspects (use the same terms as used in the paper), and state which of the paragraphs in the introduction they first occur in. Record your results in a table like that given in Table 7.2 for the example from Exercise 1. TABLE 7.2: The different aspects in the introduction and where they are introduced and their number of mentions. This example is taken from Exercise 1 and relates to Fontaine and Kohl (Fontaine and Kohl 2020). Aspect Name Paragraph number Frequency of mentions Theme climate change 1 2 Topic Microbiome 1 22 Variable Temperature 1 16 Study system Two anuran species 3 5 Hypothesis “bullfrog gut microbial communities would exhibit more rapid plasticity compared to those of the green frog…” 4 1 Once, again I have used Fontaine and Kohl (Fontaine and Kohl 2020) as the example and highlighted the theme, topic, variable, study system and hypothesis in Figure 7.4. Note how different the number of mentions of each aspect (Table 7.2) is distrubuted across the paragraphs. For example, the theme (climate change) is only mentioned in the first and second paragraphs. The study system is only introduced in the last paragraph in this paper, but typically has a paragraph to itself (see Table: (#tab:intro)). As we would expect, the hypothesis comes only at the end of the last paragraph of the introduction. In contrast, the topic (microbiome) and key variable (temperature) are mentioned extensively in every paragraph of the introduction. FIGURE 7.4: Distribution of the theme, topic, variable, study system and hypothesis in the introduction. In this paper by Fontaine and Kohl (Fontaine and Kohl 2020) I have highlighted the theme (climate change = red), topic (microbiome = pink), variable (temperature = green), study system (anurans = yellow) and hypothesis (blue). Question: Are the order of the paragraphs always increasing for each of your aspects in each of your five papers? Question: What would be the result of changing this order, or inverting it? Question: How much do your introduction results differ from those suggested in Table 7.1? 7.4 Starting to write with an outline When you are ready to write your own chapter, or if you have already started, the way in which you go about this is to create the same sort of outline that we produced in Exercise 1. First list your different aspects that you have in the introduction of your chapter, as you did in Exercise 2. Next, begin to plan out your formula as a bullet-point outline (Figure 7.5). Start by writing a general sentence for the subject of each paragraph. Then use sub-points to plan each sentence within the paragraph. Lastly, annotate these with citations that you want to use. Personally, as an advisor, I’d prefer to see the bare outline before you start the writing proper. This allows advisor and student to get on the same page to be sure that what is planned is thought out. FIGURE 7.5: Example of an outline draft of the introduction. In this outline taken from Measey et al. (2020), paragraphs are paragraphs are indicated by the solid dots, and points to make inside the paragraphs by hollow dots. Each paragraph has an argument sketched out within it. In the above example, you may not know what EICAT and SEICAT are (they are scoring systems used for environmental - EICAT - or socio-economic - SEICAT - impacts of alien species), but I would hope that you can follow the broad argument of the introduction explaining why the study should be done. 7.4.1 Next flesh out the outline with citations In the next stage, ‘fleshing out’, I ask that citations for statements above be added along with any examples. Figure 7.6 is an example of the citations added to paragraph 4 above. FIGURE 7.6: Example of a fleshed out outline of a paragraph in the introduction. In this outline taken from Measey et al. (2020), citations and relevant figures have been inserted for each of the statements. 7.5 Exercise 3: Where are the different aspects discussed? As we saw above, the introduction funnels into the hypothesis by building up all of the necessary information to understand the hypothesis in the context of a bigger theme. In this exercise, we are going to do the same again, but to focus this time on the Discussion. The discussion should contain the same major aspects, but the emphasis this time is trying to reinterpret them in the light of the testing of your hypothesis. Very simply speaking, the funnel of the introduction is now inverted within the discussion (Figure 7.1). For each of your five papers, I want you to name each of the aspects (use the same terms as used in the paper), and state which of the paragraphs in the discussion they first occur in. Record your results in a table like that given in Table 7.2 for the example from Exercise 1. Question: Are the order of the paragraphs consistent in each of your five papers? Question: How much do your introduction results differ from those suggested in Table 7.3? 7.6 Writing the text And once you have the fleshed out outline, it’s time to start writing your first draft. Remember that the best way to start writing is to do just that. It’s unlikely that your first effort will be the one that you will finally submit. But start writing. Then read, go back and polish. And keep polishing until you achieve your goal. Although we have concentrated on the introduction in this workshop, the same basic approach to filling out the formula can be taken with the rest of the chapter. We will go through this later in the course, but if you want to read further now you can find this covered in How to write a PhD in Biological Sciences. I have added here Table 7.1 and Table 7.3 which summarise the suggested paragraph structure. The Introduction The Materials and Methods The Results The Discussion TABLE 7.1: A guide to the contents of each paragraph of your introduction. Although you should not feel constrained by this suggestion, it might help you get started when planning your bullet-pointed structure of the introduction before you start writing. Introduction Paragraph Description of contents Paragraph 1 Overview of the relevance of the major theme - The relevance for the topic to the theme - Gap in theme / topic and how it aids understanding: Key variable - independent Paragraph 2 Variable in the context of the theme / topic - Structured argument on the consideration for measurement of key variable: Dependent vs Independent, Known mechanistic relationships - Examples and importance of previous studies Paragraph 3 Study system justification - Dependent and independent variables and knowledge of them within the study system: any important co-variates Paragraph 4 Identify the problem that you are responding to - Use structured argument with examples to justify approach: (Experiment, Field observations, Phylogeny, Etc.) Paragraph 5 State the aim of your study - Name: Dependent, Independent, Co-variates - State the hypothesis (H1) - State the importance of the predicted outcome for theme / topic TABLE 7.3: A guide to the contents of each paragraph of your discussion. Although you should not feel constrained by this suggestion, it might help you get started when planning your bullet-pointed structure of the discussion before you start writing. Discussion Paragraph Description of contents Paragraph 1 Respond to your hypothesis - Provide a highlight of other important results - Mention supporting or conflicting literature Paragraph 2 Discuss the way in which your results impact the theme / topic - Use logical argument with existing results from literature - New insights given your findings Paragraph 3 The context of your results in the existing literature - Support and conflicting evidence - Use logical argument to determine how to interpret your results in the context of previous evidence Paragraph 4 Major caveats that impact on your methods, results and how this impacts your conclusions - Ways in which caveats might be overcome in future - Other important future studies arising Paragraph 5 Explain how your result adds to the evidence toward the theme (intro para 1) - Other important lessons learned 7.7 Summing up the formula workshop In this workshop we have concentrated on the structure of the introduction and discussion of a chapter. In reviewing your own five papers, you have seen that the formula is not something strict, neither does it need to be adhered to. Instead, it is a tool that you can use to get you started writing. Independent of whether or not you use the formula provided, the important aspect of this workshop is to appreciate why we need to be consistent with introducing all the aspects of our hypothesis in the introduction. We are attempting to communicate complex ideas, and these mean that we need to be systematic and methodical in our approach to communicating. It is vitally important that the reader understands why we have chosen the hypothesis we have, and the background information that our decisions are based upon. I hope that you can come back to the exercises in this workshop in the future and use them to help you make sense of what you are reading as well as when you need to write. This is the end of this workshop on using a formula to write a chapter. If you find any problems with this workshop, please be sure to let me know.

We will cover the bigger plans for an entire chapter in another workshop. Here we will look specifically about writing paragraphs and sentences. Much of what you will read here should have been covered when you were learning English in school, but it is useful to go over this again to see how it applies to writing in the natural sciences. In this workshop you will learn how to: plan the different parts of a paragraph construct a logical argument get inspiration for some useful phrases commonly used in science Elsewhere, we will learn about writing concisely, maximising the information content in the shortest possible number of words, and putting paragraphs together to form an introduction or discussion. Don’t expect that you will be able to achieve a perfect paragraph the first time that you write it. Instead, be prepared to write something that will take work over time to make it more concise, improve and polish. The easiest way to approach this is to get everything you need into the paragraph first, and then cut and trim until it’s right. Then put it away and critically read it again the next day; then the next week; and even the next month. Have other colleagues read and critique it and take that on board to reformulate and improve it. Be prepared to work hard on every paragraph that you write. This approach will reward you with well written science. 9.1 The stages of writing You can think of the process of writing a paragraph in the following set of stages: knowing the relevant literature decide on the aim and plan your paragraph generate the content make the content concise through polishing check that the citations you have used are correct read and share what you have produced to get feedback Each of these steps is a separate process, and you should not try to do them simultaneously. For example, do not plan your paragraph at the same time that you generate the content. Ideally, you should decide on the aim of all the paragraphs in your introduction or discussion before you start planning their content. When you are generating the content, do not worry about how it looks or reads. Try to get all of the ideas that you have planned down onto the page. When generating content, avoid going back to read the relevant literature. That should already be in your head or in your plan. If you do know it is there, but can’t remember it at that moment, then rather insert a place-holder that will allow you to find the correct citation later. There is another step in the stages of writing for checking literature. If you interrupt your content generation to read, you are likely to become distracted and lose your concentration. Do not try to generate the content at the same time as copyediting or polishing (Grogan 2021). If you treat each of these steps separately, you will find that writing becomes easier. 9.1.1 Get over yourself All writers go through a stage where they feel that everything they have written is bad. This is normal. Nobody is good at writing from birth. It is a talent that you acquire over time through practice. More importantly, scientific writing is a particular kind of writing that itself requires its own skill set. Table 9.1 contains some ideas that you can do to help yourself. This is not exhaustive, so keep looking out for new ideas until you find something that works for you. TABLE 9.1: Tips to help make your writing easier. Here are a number of ideas that you can adopt to help with your writing experience. Adapted from Grogan (2021). Tip number Tip name Tip description 1. Turn off your phone alerts, emails, chats, etc. It is important that you are not distracted during your writing time. If it helps, then wear headphones and listen to music to help you focus. Tell others around you not to interrupt you. 2. Use a set period followed by a break with a reward. The Pomodoro technique, is a set of 25 minute working sessions followed by 5 minutes of break and reward. Then another 25 minutes of concentrated writing time. You can try this and see if it works for you. 3. Prepare well. You cannot produce good content unless you have prepared first through your knowledge of the relevant literature and writing an aim and a plan. 4. Don’t get stuck in a chasm of despair (Heard 2018). Known by many names including ‘writers block’ this is a place where you feel that you can’t produce any content. If this happens to you then do not stop. If you take a break you will find that you are in the same place next time you sit down to write. This will soon mean that every time you write you will associate writing with the chasm. Instead, push through by ‘free writing’. This is where you produce any content that is (as much as possible) on topic. Keep free writing until your target time period is over. The reality is that when we are generating content, much of it may get junked at a later date. This is normal. However, if you don’t generate anything, there will be nothing to sort through and polish later. 5. Get feedback from your network. Your colleagues are also likely to be struggling with writing, as everyone struggles to some extent. Perhaps they have tips and tricks that you can learn from. You are likely to be able to find a way in which to get support from your network if you approach your colleagues in an open and equitable way. The could be practical help like getting space and time to dedicate to your writing. Or it could be moral support. You could time your break/reward sessions together. Reach out to those around you and start talking about writing and what they do that helps or hinders them. 9.2 Paragraph aim The first thing to think about when you want to write a paragraph is what you actually want to say within it. This may sound obvious, but writers often seem to forget what they wanted to communicate. It is really helpful to write down the purpose of your paragraph. Here are some examples for different paragraphs: introduce relevant variables of the study organism contrast findings of experiment with previously published results identify major knowledge gaps in the field justify the use of variables using a logical argument introduce a new technique Write your paragraph aim in bold at the start of your paragraph. Use an indicator like ‘&gt;’ or ‘#’ to remind you that it is not part of the text. I suggest that you keep this aim present in your written work even when you submit the first draft to your advisor so that they know what your plan is. You can modify your plan as you write. This is actually advisable as you get a better idea of what the aim of the paragraph is, you can make your aim more sophisticated. Updating your aim as you write will help you write more sophisticated aims in future. 9.3 Paragraph plan Now that you have an aim, you can write down a list of items that you want to try to include within the paragraph. This should include a list of papers that you want to cite in your paragraph. It is important that you have already assembled and read the relevant literature on this topic as you must know how each paper can be cited. Depending on the aim of the paragraph, it could also include a list of the variables that you need to introduce or discuss in your paragraph, the important results of your study, or important knowledge gaps. 9.3.1 Paragraph structure Next we are going to decide how to structure the paragraph. There are three important parts to your paragraph: the topic sentence the contents and supporting sentences the summary and link sentence Because a paragraph carries a new topic, it is important to have the first sentence of a paragraph that communicates the contents. Remember that we aim to be concise, so we might also make this topic sentence carry an important citation and even suggest the first part of the argument that we introduce or discuss. In the following paragraph, the topic sentence is in bold. The following sentences support and provide examples of this proposed idea. The supporting sentences are normal font. The clincher sentence is in italics. This paragraph starts with a topic sentence which contains the principle idea that citations are needed to produce examples. The following sentences put this idea into the context of your study. This should be based on examples from existing literature with the corresponding in-text citations provided (Smith et al. 2017; Jones 2018). You can use examples in your paragraph to make your point. For examples, Smith and Jones (2017) carried out a study that showed that examples without citations have no credibility for readers. And this was backed up by another study by Jones and Smith (2018), which provided further evidence for the need to provide examples. Once you’ve provided your evidence, and introduced any covariates that you need to, like the use of literature for examples, then you are ready to sum up and link. After reading this paragraph, the reader will know why citations are needed for examples, and they’ll be ready to read more about the topic of writing a paragraph in more detail. 9.3.1.1 The topic sentence A topic sentence allows the reader to understand quickly the idea/topic you are putting forward in the paragraph. It must be in the context in which you are going to develop the same topic. There’s no point in just mentioning a topic in passing or using it in a different way than you will later. Make your topic sentence relatively simple. Don’t be tempted to add multiple clauses. This will be a rule for all of your sentences. If the topic sentence is too complex, you’ll lose your reader right at the beginning of the paragraph. Instead, you need a clear topic sentence that will make the reader confident that they know what you are talking about. If you are using a technical term, be sure that it has already been defined or do so in your topic sentence. Once it is introduced, keep the terminology consistent. 9.3.1.2 Supporting sentences Supporting sentences convey all the relevant information to the reader. They are going to be statements that contain many citations, showing readers where the original ideas came from. Be sure to keep these sentences on topic, and regularly refer back to your outline to make sure that you keep to the original aim of the paragraph. These are the meat of the paragraph and it’s really important to get them right. If you are writing about differences, then state which way the difference is. For example, if tulips are larger than lilies, then say this. Do not tell them that the size of tulips is different to that of lilies. Telling your audience that something is different than something else only ends up leaving them guessing about the directionality. There’s no point in drip dripping this information through. Set it down in as little space as possible so that your reader doesn’t get bored. Sentences within the meat of the paragraph interact, and there’s a great example to show how this is done here. These interactions usually dwell around pertinent variables (such as those that you are going to deal with in your paper). By using the same or similar words within the paragraph, you are able to demonstrate to the reader how those different points interact. While repeating the names of the variables, or their abbreviations, can be helpful, repeating descriptive words becomes quite tedious to the reader. Repeatedly reading the same ideas repeated over and over quickly bores the reader. Bored readers are less likely to take in what you write, even if you are repeating the same information (yes, I’m repeating myself - boring isn’t it). It will also give the reader the impression that your vocabulary is very limited. Hint: You can quickly get a synonym to make your paragraph more diverse. An example of the synonym function in Microsoft Word (other wordprocessors are available) - right click on the highlighted word. This can allow you to go back and replace your repeated word with: recurrent, frequent, recurring, repetitive, constant or continual. That’s more than enough to spice up the paragraph. However, if you’re not sure whether a word is correctly replacing another, ask a friend to read it or look it up in a dictionary. Your supporting sentences are best built in the formula of an argument. 9.3.1.3 The last sentence of the paragraph: the clincher Once you’ve conveyed all of the information that you planned to impart in your aim, it’s time for the last sentence. This should conclude the evidence that you’ve provided on your topic. Try not to make it lame. For example: “This shows that little work has been done.” One of my pet hates is authors who insist on telling us that “little work has been done” on their topic, as if this was a justification for doing anything. Instead, make it a real clincher about why the topic is important, or how and why you will tackle it. Instead (or as well if you can), you may want this sentence to link on to another paragraph (topic), especially if flow is important at that part of your outline. If you have just constructed a paragraph with thesis, antithesis and synthesis, then your clincher might be simply to underline that your approach in the paper is to investigate the synthesis. Either way, make sure that your last sentence is on topic, and one that sticks in the readers’ minds. 9.4 Exercise 1: Writing a Paragraph Using your keywords (from the previous workshop), I want you to write a paragraph with the following aim: Justify the use of your variables using a logical argument Using your own words provide the following information before you start: Present your aim (using your contents) Provide a list of literature that you plan to use What is the aim of your paragraph? How are you planning to make a logical argument about the use of your variables How will you sum up your paragraph? Once you have provided these five items, have a go at writing your paragraph. Make sure that you know and can see your plan before you begin to generate the content. When you are generating the content, limit yourself to 25 minutes. Because you have already planned the content, you should be ready and able to generate the content. If you are not confident with English, generate this content in your own language. It should flow relatively easily during that period, but it won’t be perfect. Once it’s written, give yourself a break. Then read through the paragraph again and begin to make it concise by cutting out unnecessary words. Give it to someone else in the class to read and ask them to label the different paragraph parts. Once they have read it, ask them to tell you using their own words and preferably a different language (and without looking at what you’ve written) what the paragraph was about. Does their explanation sound like your aim? If not, what was different? Make a note, read your paragraph again and determine whether you can see it from their viewpoint. 9.5 Construct a logical argument in your writing Writing is not straightforward. Your objective is to communicate with a reader, someone who you’ve likely never met. You need to communicate highly complex information. But more than that you need them to see things as you do. You need to provide them with your reasoning and your argument, and have it make sense to them; preferably to the point where they agree with you. To communicate, you need to start from common ground. The beginning of your introduction starts with the most general concepts in the context in which you are writing. The context depends on your audience, and this, in turn, relates to the particular journal that you are writing for. Even if you are writing a thesis, you should pick out a target journal for each of the chapters. Once you’ve established the common ground, you need to carry the reader towards the hypothesis or question that you propose. The easiest way to do this is to make use of a logical argument: 9.5.1 Thesis, antithesis and synthesis This approach of using an argument in your paragraph is a classical way of writing that has its origin from the German philosopher Hegel. Philosophers refer to it as: thesis, antithesis and synthesis. The first statement is the proposed idea that you wish to pursue in your study. The antithesis negates the first statement, suggesting an alternative for the reader to consider. Lastly,the synthesis provides clarity on how to resolve the differences between thesis and antithesis. In scientific writing, each of these statements would be followed by citations that support their content. This classical writing style lends itself to the use of examples, such that both thesis and antithesis are presented with examples that illustrate each statement. A series of statements that introduce a starting premise, provide evidence for and against that premise (perhaps adding in an example that makes your point), point out what missing information would allow reaching a better understanding of said premise, and logically conclude that what you are doing is going to help fill this gap. This logical argument style is most prominent in the early introduction of your manuscript, although the entire introduction could be seen as one long logical argument, with a few smaller more precise arguments being thrown in along the way. You might also use a logical argument in your discussion to explain how you deduce certain inferences from your results, or provide a logical extension for a future study. The following science argumentation model (Table 9.2) is modified from Cope et al. (2013). Try using this model to guide your writing of a paragraph of your introduction (or discussion) where you attempt a logical argument. For a more in depth treatment of using arguments in science, see Toulmin (2003). TABLE 9.2: A framework for a scientific argument. Modified from Cope et al. (2013), this model argument can be followed to provide as a way of getting started. Structure Explanation A position statement / question / hypothesis / theory / problematic This could be the big idea in your manuscript, or one of several competing concepts that you are introducing. The context in which you are writing might mean that this idea theory needs no introduction (e.g. the theory of evolution in the journal Evolution), but you need to be confident that your audience will understand what you are proposing. Remember to cite the person who came up with the idea. Claim 1 One potential explanation or interpretation of the original idea. Evidence: Literature that agrees with this interpretation (could include an example) Reasoning: Your justification that links the evidence to the claim or interpretation. Claim 2 Another potential explanation, of the previous interpretation of the original idea Counter-claims Other possible interpretations or counter-claims. Conclusions Evaluation: your judgement on weighing up the evidence for the idea. If your logical argument doesn’t arrive immediately, don’t force it. Give it some thinking time to let it settle in. I find that logical arguments develop best when I’m not sitting at my desk writing. They come when I’m reading other papers (especially those with well-written arguments), taking a deep, hot bath, or when I’m out running in the mountains. If you are more social, talk through your logical argument with others, perhaps over a cup of coffee. It really helps to keep the ideas turning in your head. Don’t cut yourself off from work thoughts when you are away from work. 9.6 Exercise 2: Your logical argument Now that you have learned how to write a logical argument, I want you to take your paragraph from the first exercise, and write the contents and supporting sentences again. Plan your argument by: Listing your claims List counter claims Provide reason why your claims are better Conclude with your judgement Once you have your argument planned, re-write it as the contents and supporting sentences of your paragraph. Try reading it a few times and polish it a little before giving it to your colleague. Ask them for feedback on the paragraph. Did they understand it any better? There are other shorter forms that might suit you better. Consider another classic form of the scientific argument: “compare and contrast” which allows you as a writer to quickly familiarise your reader with some key examples. Another sentence structure to consider is explaining cause and effect. Scientists have certain phrases that quickly 9.7 Using the academic phrasebank The last part of this workshop will be to learn how to use the Academic Phrasebank. The phrasebank makes the nuts and bolts of your writing easier, by providing phrases that are well understood by your audience. Our aim is communication, so if we can use phrases that are familiar, we are likely to make the communication easier. For your paragraph, you have a logical argument about which variables you want to use. One way to do this is to compare and contrast the variables. Academic Phrasebank has a section on compare and contrast that will help you compose some of these phrases. You may also want to introduce the differences and similarities of your variables. 9.8 Exercise 3: Using the academic phrasebank as your guide Explore the different General Language functions (on the left side of the Academic Phrasebank website), and find one that suits your paragraph from the previous exercises. List the different phrases that you think you could use Re-write your paragraph with two or three of these different phrases Give these different paragraphs to your colleague, together with your original paragraph, and ask them which sounds the best. These phrases won’t necessarily sound the best, but they can really help when you are feeling stuck for what to say, or especially if you want to use similar types of arguments but without using the same words. 9.9 Summing up the workshop on writing paragraphs In future, when you are planning your paragraph, you can find the phrases that you would like to use and list them along with the other components: Present your aim (using your contents) Provide a list of literature that you plan to use What is the subject of your paragraph? How are you planning to make a logical argument about the use of your variables How will you sum up your paragraph? Which phrases from the academic phrasebank might be used in this paragraph? This is the end of this workshop on writing paragraphs. If you find any problems with this workshop, please be sure to let me know.
